But there is another possibility; if the same defender holds 4 \Hs and 4 \Ss you will be able to squeeze him in those two suits.

You win the \CK and play \H A K Q to test the \H suit, but West discards a \C on the \HQ. (You tested \Hs first because of dummy's limited entries to the \S suit.) [NEXT]

Next play your 4 \D winners, discarding a \C from dummy. East follows twice, then starts to feel the pressure. He cannot discard the \HJ because it is guarding your \H2, and since he can see those 4 \Ss in dummy he doesn't want to discard a \S. He discards both his \Cs, trusting West to guard that suit. [NEXT]

Of course if East had discarded his \HJ you would have cashed your \H2 and then taken three \S winners.

You just executed a Squeeze Play and you didn't even have to try. [NEXT]

This time it is West who holds the only Guards in both \Ss and \Hs.

You play the \CA and he must give up one of those Guards.}

You have 11 sure winners in your hand and dummy's \DQ makes 12. Your main hope is for a 3-3 \D split in which case dummy's fourth \D will be a winner.

But there is another possibility in case the \Ds don't split. Dummy's \HQ is a THREAT card which is GUARDED only by West's \HA. If it is West who has the 4 \Ds you will be able to squeeze him.

You ruff the \HK and play 5 more \C winners, being careful not to discard a \D or the \HQ from dummy.  [NEXT]

Play the \S A K and West begins to feel the heat. [NEXT]

But now you play the SQUEEZE card, the \CA. West absolutely cannot throw away his \HA, so he discards a \D instead.

Since he still has the \HA you know dummy's \HQ is useless so you discard it. Dummy's fourth \D has become a winner. [NEXT]

East holds the only Guards in both red suits, but he cannot be squeezed.

You must play from dummy BEFORE East plays, so he just matches whatever you do.

If you discard the \HQ East will throw his \HA. If you discard dummy's fourth \D, East will throw his fourth \D.}

As you see, neither of them splits. However since one defender, East in this case, holds both Guards you should be able to squeeze him. 

Visualize what would happen, though, if you win the first trick and then play your 4 \H winners. East would play his 3 \Cs and 2 \Hs on those 5 tricks and he would not be squeezed. The problem is that you have to RECTIFY THE COUNT. [NEXT]

 [NEXT]

East has no problems on the first 3, he just plays his 2 \Hs and 1 \C. [NEXT]

You will toss dummy's \C8 and East will have to decide whether it is better for him to throw a \S or a \D. He doesn't know that discarding either one is going to hand you the contract, so he will probably discard a \D.  }

Play the \CK, \CJ, then over to your \CQ. [NEXT]

When you now play your \CA, discarding a \S from dummy, West is squeezed.

If he discards the \ST, then his \SQ will fall underneath your \SA, establishing your \SJ.

For a squeeze to operate you will need to lose one trick and the time to do that is right now. Let West hold the \HK and win his \H continuation with your \HA. [NEXT]

You might as well find out about the \Ss right now. Play the \S A K Q. 

Too bad, West discards a \H on the third round of \Ss.  [NEXT]

Play the \DA, then \D K Q. 

East will follow to all three \Ds.  [NEXT]

Play dummy's \DJ and discard your \HT.

If East discards the \SJ you will cash dummy's \S6, then win the last 3 \C tricks. 

So East will no doubt throw a \C instead. In which case you win the last 4 \C tricks.

Squeezes are so very satisfying.}

At first things look hopeless, but remember this is a lesson on squeeze plays. From the opening lead you know that West must hold the \HQ. If he also holds the \SK you will be able to squeeze him in \Hs and \Ss.

You let the \HK win, (hoping he will play another \H), but he plays a small trump instead which you win in your hand. [NEXT]

Then take your 3 \C winners, ending in your hand. [NEXT]

Discard the \S5 from dummy on the third \D.  [NEXT]

But when you play the \D7 he is squeezed.

He cannot dump his \SK because you would throw the \H8 and dummy would be high.

So he will discard the \HT instead. At this point you know that the \SQ is worthless so you discard it. You win the final two tricks with the \HA and \HJ.}

You must win the next T tricks but you only have 9 winners.

East opened 1NT, showing 15-17 points, and West has already produced 2 Jacks. So both the \SQ and \DK are with East and you will have to put the squeeze on him. [NEXT]

Since you need all the tricks the count is already rectified.

You plan to squeeze East by running the long \Hs in your hand, but the problem is that the \DQ is not a Threat card yet. To make it a Threat you need to unblock dummy's \DA. So play the \DA, then pull trumps with the \H A Q. [NEXT]

With 6 cards left to be played you are ready to apply pressure to East.

Play the \H 9 8, discarding \Ds from dummy. East is not troubled yet, he can discard the \DJ and the \S3. [NEXT]

Play the \H6 and throw dummy's \D6.

East can choose his fate. If he throws the \S9 you will know that his \SQ will drop since his third card MUST be the \DK. So you would just play to the high \Ss and the \SJ would be good.

Or, he can throw his \DK which makes your \DQ a winner. [NEXT]

Let's back up and pretend you had NOT unblocked the \DA. We will just add one \D to everybody's hand and look at the ending.

Now when you play your \H6 as a squeeze card you have a problem. You are squeezing dummy, not East.

If you discard the \D6 East will throw his \DJ, then sit back and wait for his \SQ trick.

But if you discard dummy's \SJ instead, East will match that by throwing his \S9, then sit back and wait for his \DK trick.

Only by visualizing the ending and using the Vienna Coup can this hand be made.}

In case the squeeze becomes necessary you should rectify the count, so you win the first trick, pull trumps in two rounds, then give up a \H trick. [NEXT]

You now make the key play of taking dummy's \SA before running three rounds of \Cs. [NEXT]

As you see, East was able to find discards on your first three trump leads, but when you play the \C7 and discard dummy's \S2 he is squeezed.

He can see that if he discards a \D dummy will be high, so he will probably throw the \SK in hopes that his partner holds the \SQ. But you have that card and you make the slam. [NEXT]

The only difference would be that to rectify the count you would have to hold up once on the opening \HK.}

Then, your second thought should be that dummy's \HJ is a Threat against West's \HQ, so if it is West who holds 4 \Ss you will be able to squeeze him.

Since the contract is 7NT you take the first trick with the \HA. [NEXT]

You continue with the \DQ and \D K, East discarding a \H and a \C. [NEXT]

You start playing dummy's \D winners. [NEXT]

When you play the \D5 East must keep both \Ss to guard against your \S7. So he discards the \C6, hoping partner can stop that suit.

Even looking at all four hands here it is still very difficult to come up with a plan.

Here's a hint: If West holds 3 \Cs, (and you see that he does), can you squeeze him in \Cs and \Ss? [NEXT]

The big problem with trying to squeeze West in the black suits right now is that East actually holds a \S guard. But you can fix that.

Play dummy's \HQ and \HT, then ruff a \S, then pull the last trump.  [NEXT]

Then lead dummy's \C7 to your \CK. [NEXT]

But maybe you can make his partner do the job for you.

At trick 2 you play a \S. [NEXT]

You discard 2 \Ds from dummy and a \C from your hand.

East cannot spare either a \H or a \D so he also throws a \C. [NEXT]

West will almost surely cash his \S2.

You and dummy both discard a \C and East also must discard a \C.

It doesn't matter what West plays next, lets say it is a \C. [NEXT]

East is truly squeezed. If he discards a \H, dummy's \H5 will become a winner. but if he discards a \D then you will get a third \D trick and the contract.

Since it was West who started the squeeze by cashing his last \S, this is called a Suicide Squeeze. BUT, what if West had not cashed that \S? [NEXT]

Suppose West is a really expert defender and avoids the Suicide Squeeze by just refusing to cash his winning \S. It doesn't matter what else he plays instead, so let us assume it is a \C.

You win in your hand and establish a \D winner by playing \DA, \DK, and a small \D. East wins but cannot reach his partner's hand for that good \S.

And since West had 3 \Hs and a very long \S suit it is pretty likely that East guards the \Ds also. You will try to squeeze East in \Cs and \Ds, but first you must lose a trick to rectify the count.

So you play a low \D from each hand. [NEXT]

He will then play the \SK, which you must ruff in your hand. [NEXT]

 [NEXT]

Play dummy's \HJ.

East gets to choose his own fate - discarding a protector in one of the two suits. Of course, whichever suit he discards you will throw the opposite one.

Yet another slam, courtesy of the Squeeze Play!}

South is to play 6\H. West leads the \DK. Perhaps you wouldn't have bid slam with North's cards, but he has been watching you pull off some fantastic squeeze plays and he has every confidence you will do it again.

And you are 99.9% sure he also has the \SA, so dummy's \SK will also be a Threat card against him.

You should be able to squeeze him in the two suits. What is your first act? [NEXT]

But not this defender, not this time.

He exits with the \H3 which you take with your \HQ. [NEXT]

You throw a \S from dummy and West discards \Ss and \Ds. [NEXT]

Discard the \ST and \D7 from dummy.

West discards the \SQ and \S9. [NEXT]

He obviously is not going to throw his \SA and make dummy high, so he will instead bare his \DQ.

So you dump dummy's \SK and win the last two tricks with the \DA and then the \DJ.}

North's 2\H cue-bid shows \S support and at least a limit-raise or better. South is to play 4\S. West leads the \HA, then a \H to East's \HK. East plays a third round of \Hs.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

The reason you are seeing it like this is that you must do some deducing first.

You saw the bidding and you know that West started with the \HA and East started with the \HK.

Before you can make a good Plan you need to figure out where the \SA, \DK and \CK are located. [NEXT]

Now on with the plan. East/West took the first two \H tricks and then played a third \H which you won, discarding the \D2 from dummy.  [NEXT]

This pulls all the trumps and also serves to rectify the count for your upcoming squeeze.

**By the way, notice that if East had played any other way he would have handed you the contract. [NEXT]

So dummy's \DQ cannot be one of the Threat cards. Instead you must make the \DJ in YOUR hand a Threat. You do that by playing the \DA immediately, a Vienna Coup. [NEXT]

Overtake dummy's \ST and run three more \Ss.

Discard all three \Ds from dummy.

East will discard his 2 \Hs, the \D9 and the \C6. [NEXT]

Play your \S2 and discard dummy's \C4.

Poor East will squirm and try to figure out which discard is best because he doesn't actually KNOW what two cards you have left.

But you aren't squirming because you know that whichever card he throws it will give you your contract.}
