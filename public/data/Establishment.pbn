South is to play 3NT. West leads the \SJ.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

Winners:   \S = 3     \H = 1  \D = 0    \C = 1 Total = 5

You need 4 more winners, and they will come from the \D suit once you have knocked out the \DA. But there is one danger to avoid - if the defenders don't take the \DA on the first round dummy won't have a \D to lead back to your hand. So to make sure you have an entry back you win the first trick with dummy's \SK, saving your \SQ.

Click NEXT to see the hands. [NEXT]

[PLAY N:SK,S:S3]

Next start playing \Ds, first \DQ, then \DK. Assume the defenders take their \DA on the second round.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

[PLAY N:DQ,N:D3,S:DK,S:D4]

Win whatever they now play and come to your hand with the \SQ to enjoy your three established \Ds for 9 tricks total.

You were counting on North to have a little better hand than that! South is to play 4\S. West leads the \S6, East plays \S4.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

Losers:   \S = 0     \H = 2  \D = 0    \C = 2 Total = 4

You must find a place for one of those losers and that will mean establishing the \D suit. If \Ds split 3-3 that will be pretty easy so you should plan to deal with a 4-2 split. Dummy entries are limited so win the first trick in your hand with the \SA.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

[PLAY N:S2,S:SA]

Before you pull any trumps you start on the \Ds by playing \DA, \DK and then ruffing a \D with the \SK. West follows to the first two, then discards a \H.

[PLAY N:DK,N:D6,N:D3,S:SK,S:DA,S:D5]

North's \C bid was Stayman, but he didn't match \Ss. South is to play 3NT. West leads the \DJ, East plays \DK.

Make a Plan, then click NEXT. [NEXT]

Winners:   \S = 2     \H = 1  \D = 2    \C = 3 Total = 8

With the \DK onside you have 8 tricks, and only need one more. If \Cs split 3-3 you can get 2 extras and make an overtrick. But when you are missing 6 cards they are more likely to be 4-2 than 3-3. Since you only need 4 \C tricks you should establish the suit with a duck.

Win the \DA and play a small \C from each hand.

Click NEXT. [NEXT]

[PLAY N:D6,N:C3,S:DA,S:C2]

The defense gets a cheap trick in \Cs but you don't mind because you still have a small \C for an entry to dummy. You win whatever they return and take the rest of your winners, including 4 tricks in \Cs!

You are very lucky. Apparently West led from \H K Q so you won an undeserved \H trick. Now, if \Cs split 2-2 you can make 12 tricks! But hold it a minute. If you play dummy's two top \Cs and they DON'T split 2-2 you will only  win two \C tricks and the contract will fail. Instead you should play a small \C from dummy right now. The defenders will win the trick easily, but you will win their return and you will still have a \C to get to dummy's 6 \C winners!

You need two more winners and dummy's \Dsuit is your only hope. IF \Ds split 3-2 and IF the defenders don't take too many winners in their suit(s) you can establish \Ds by ducking twice.

Win the first \S. If you hold up they might pocket the \S trick and switch to another suit where you only have two stoppers.

Next play a small \D from each hand. Win the return (probably a \S) and duck a second \D.

If the defenders can only take 2 \S tricks now you are home-free since dummy's 3 \Ds are now established.

Winners:   \S = 2     \H = 0  \D = 2    \C = 1 Total = 5

Obviously you need to establish 4 \H winners and by driving out the \HA you can manage that handily. The problem is that dummy has only one sure entry, (the \SA), and the defenders may be good enough to hold up their \HA twice.

To assure the contract you should win the first trick in your hand with the \SK. Then play \HQ, \HJ overtaking with dummy's \HK so you can continue establishing the suit while you still have that \S entry.

One of the two red losers must be discarded on dummy's \C suit. So you pull trumps, taking two rounds, with \SK and \SQ. Then play two top \Cs and ruff a \C.

Winners:   \S = 0     \H = 2  \D = 1    \C = 3 Total = 6

You only need one more winner and you have several possibilities. The \H finesse might work, or the \Cs might split 3-3. But you need to consider the defenders winners also. They have already scored 2 \D tricks and will get 2 more as soon as they gain the lead. (The spot cards told you that West has a 5-card \D suit.) Plus they have the 2 top \Ss which they can take whenever they like. So if your play sets up just one more trick for them you will go down.

No, you must establish \Ss, the suit where they have 2 winners anyway. So you play a \S which West wins. He takes his 2 \Ds but you are now home free. When you gain the lead again you will get your \S winner established and only lose 2 \Ss and 4 \Ds.

Winners:   \S = 2     \H = 2  \D = 1    \C = 3 Total = 8

You only need one more winner and if \Ds split 3-3 you can easily establish a trick in that suit. But what if \Ds split 4-2? If the \CJ falls you can get an extra \C trick. In fact, no matter how the \Cs are arranged you can establish your extra trick there.

First make sure that you win the second trick with the \SK, keeping dummy's \SQ for a later entry. Then play \CK, and \CQ overtaking with dummy's \CA. Then play the \CT, losing to the \CJ but establishing the \C9 while you still have the \SQ as an entry.

Winners:   \S = 1     \H = 3  \D = 2    \C = 1Total = 7

You need to find another winner and the chances are not good. If either black suit splits 3-3 you can establish dummy's fourth card in that suit. But with West's opening lead of the \CK it is unlikely that \Cs will split. So your only slim hope is that the \Ss split 3-3 and dummy's fourth \S will be a winner.

Win the first trick and play a \S to the \SA. Then play another \S. The defense will win and probably take some \C tricks . When they have finished and play a red card, you win it and play a third round of \Ss. If both defenders follow to all three \Ss then dummy's \S8 is now a winner.

Losers:   \S = 1     \H = 0  \D = 2    \C = 3Total = 6

Obviously you don't really have 6 losers since some of those \Ds and \Cs can be ruffed in dummy. But if you are playing against competent defenders you will only be able to ruff two of them because every time they get the lead they will play a trump. So you must figure on ruffing 2 losers and establishing dummy's fifth \S for a discard of the other one.

Win the \CA and immediately play your \SQ. The defense will win this trick and probably play a trump. Be sure to win this in dummy and then ruff a \S with a high \H. Now exit with a \C. They will win and probably play another trump. Win this one in dummy also, breathing a sigh of relief when \Hs split 2-2. Ruff another \S with your second-last trump, then play \DA and concede a \D. 

Whichever minor suit the defense plays next you ruff in dummy, then ruff the fourth \S, establishing dummy's \S8 while you still have a trump left in dummy. Dummy is now high.

Losers:   \S = 1     \H = 0  \D = 0    \C = 0Total = 1

It should be very clear that the only way to get rid of that \S loser is to discard it on dummy's \H suit. So after taking the first trick with dummy's \DA you could pull trumps, then play \HA, \HK and ruff a \H. IF the \Hs split 3-3 you could then enter dummy with the \DK and discard your loser.

The problem is that the \Hs are much more likely to split 4-2, in which case you will need to ruff twice to establish a winner. That means you will need an extra entry to dummy. 

That extra entry can only be the \CT so you must delay pulling trumps until after you ruff the first \H. Win the \DA and immediately play \HA, \HK and ruff a \H with a high \C. West discards on this \H play. Enter dummy with a trump and ruff another \H high. The suit is now established, so you pull trumps, enter dummy one last time with the \DK and discard that losing \S on the good \H8.

Winners:   \S = 2     \H = 2  \D = 1    \C = 2Total = 7

You need two more winners. They cannot possibly come from \Ss, \Hs, or \Cs since one defender must hold at least 4 cards in each of those suits. So your two extra winners must come from the \D suit.

There is no reason to hold up on the \S since the \H and \C suits also have just two stoppers. You win the \SA.

You best play next is to finesse the \DT. This may gain a trick by virtue of the finesse if West happens to hold the \DJ, but primarily you are working to establish the \D suit. Assume East wins the \DJ and returns a \S.

Again don't hold up. Take the \SK and lead another small \D, finessing with dummy's \DQ. Happily this time the finesse works, and even more happily both defenders follow suit. That means the rest of the \Ds are good and you make an overtrick.

Losers:   \S = 2     \H = 0  \D = 1    \C = 3Total = 6

With 2 tricks already gone you still have 4 losers. You could consider ruffing the 3 \C losers in dummy but that would just create a trump loser even when trumps are splitting 3-2. So it looks like you will have to establish the \D suit for discards. You could pull trumps and then play your \DQ, hoping the defenders will grab their \DA immediately. But unless they are real novices they will hold it up one round and you'll no longer be able to reach dummy.

The solution is to establish the \Ds before you use up dummy's \HK.

Ruff the third \S, then play \DQ, (which they will duck), and another \D, (which they will probably take). Win whatever they return, pull trumps ending in dummy, and enjoy your 3 \D winners.

The math is easy - you need 4 \H tricks. And you should be able to manage that by driving out the \HA. But the defenders will probably hold up one or two rounds when you play on \Hs, so you must have an outside entry to dummy. 

The \S Q J will provide that entry IF you make sure to win the first trick with your \SA as an unblocking move. If you don't do so then West will be able to keep you out of the dummy and away from those good \Hs.

But if you win the first trick with the \SA, then dummy's \S Q J will provide a guaranteed entry to the good \Hs.}

Winners:   \S = 3     \H = 0  \D = 2    \C = 2Total = 7

Needing just two more winners it looks straightforward to establish dummy's \H suit. Suppose you win the \ST and play the \H9. If the defenders win this trick you are home free. You win their \S return with your \SA, then continue \Hs to drive out their last stopper while you still have the \SK as a dummy entry.

This won't work against good defenders, who will hold up on the first \H trick and win the second. Then when they continue \Ss you won't have another \H to return to dummy, so while you can use the \SK as an entry to establish the \Hs you will never get back to use the good ones.

Instead you should win the first trick with your \SA. Now when you attack \Hs a defensive holdup won't hurt you because you have TWO \S entries, the \SJ by a finesse and the \SK.

So the \S finesse is an odds-on play to get a second dummy entry.}

3NT would have been a lot easier, but you didn't get there. South is to play 5\D. West leads the \ST.

Losers:   \S = 0     \H = 1  \D = 0    \C = 2Total = 3

The good news is that you only have one loser to get rid of. The bad news is that there doesn't seem to be a good place to put it.

Unlikely as it seems, your best candidate for establishment is dummy's \S8. West is marked with 3 \Ss, and having led the \ST there is a good chance that he also has the \S9. If so you can ruff it out.

Cover the \ST with dummy's \SJ, and when East plays one of his honors ruff in your hand. Play a trump to the \DT, East showing out. Lead the \SQ. East will be forced to play his other high honor, (if he doesn't you would discard a loser), and you ruff again. 

Back to dummy with the \DQ and ruff the \S2 with a high trump just to be safe. West drops the \S9 on this trick.

Pull West's last trump and enter dummy with the \HA and FINALLY discard a loser on the now established \S8.

Losers:   \S = 0     \H = 1  \D = 1    \C = 0Total = 2

First pull trumps with the \SA and \SQ, both defenders following. Next you must establish dummy's \C suit to get rid of one of your losers. If the suit splits 3-3 that will be easy since you have two dummy entries, one to get there to ruff the third \C and the other to get there to enjoy playing the winners. But \Cs will probably split 4-2 so the two entries won't be enough. Here's how to make the defenders help you establish the suit.

After pulling trumps, play the \C A K, then \DA. Next exit with a small \D.

The defender who won the \D trick has a problem. If he plays another \D you will get a ruff-sluff, and if he plays a \H you will play for the \HQ and \HJ to be in different hands. So he will probably play a \C.

You ruff in your hand, play a trump to dummy's \SK and ruff the \C8, establishing the \C9 while you still have the \H entry.

This was a combination of Suit Establishment and End-play. The lesson on Eliminations contains a lot more of this type of hand.}
